\title{Spectral Clustering On Ratios-of-Eigenvectors.}
\usage{
SCORE(G, K, itermax = 100, startn = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{An \eqn{n \times n} symmetric adjacency matrix with diagonals being \eqn{0} and positive
entries being \eqn{1}, where isolated nodes are not allowed.}

\item{K}{A positive integer which is no larger than \eqn{n}. This is the predefined number of communities.}

\item{itermax}{\code{k-means} parameter, indicating the maximum number of
iterations allowed. The default value is 100.}

\item{startn}{\code{k-means} parameter. The number of times the algorithm should be run with different initial
centroids. The default value is 10.}
}
\value{
\item{estall}{A factor indicating nodes' labels. Items sharing the same label are in the same community.}
}
\description{
Using ratios-of-eigenvectors to detect underlying communities.
}
\details{
\code{SCORE} is fully established in \emph{Fast community detection by
  SCORE} of Jin (2015). \code{SCORE} uses the entrywise ratios between the
  first leading eigenvector and each of the other \eqn{K-1} leading eigenvectors for
  clustering. It is noteworthy that SCORE only works on connected graphs.
  In other words, it does not allow for isolated vertices.
